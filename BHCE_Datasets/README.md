# SharpHound Data Collection for BloodHound CE Testing
## Overview
This serves as a centralized repository for data collected using the latest version of SharpHound available at the time, specifically tailored for environments provisioned by AutomatedBadLab. The purpose of this repository is to facilitate BloodHound CE testing by providing pre-collected datasets, allowing users to focus on analysis and learning without the overhead of generating their own data collections.

## Data Collection
The datasets stored here are the result of comprehensive collection runs against various environments set up by AutomatedBadLab. These environments are designed to mimic real-world Active Directory scenarios with varying complexity and configurations, providing a rich set of data for BloodHound CE analysis.

## Usage
To use these datasets for BloodHound CE testing:

1. Choose a Dataset: Select a dataset from this subdirectory that matches your testing scenario or objectives.
2. Import into BloodHound: Use BloodHound's import functionality to load the selected dataset into BloodHound CE for analysis.
3. Analyze and Explore: Utilize BloodHound CE's analytical tools to explore the dataset, identify potential attack paths, and understand the security posture of the emulated environment.
